# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to get experience using Javascript, HTML, Leaflet, Mapbox and GeoJSON data to put together a multi-layer and functional map displaying earthquakes around the world. 

## Summary
This was a great experience and allowed me to dip my toes into the above-mentioned interfaces. Understanding this is just scratching the surface, I am intriuged and would love to learn more. 

Thank you,
